# Password Generator Code
This application generates a new password on click

The application asks the user to input a desired password length. The length of the password must be between 8 to 128 characters.

The application then asks the user if their password generated will include one of each: lowercase letter, uppercase letter, number, and special character

Any invalid input will display a prompt and require the user to try again by clicking generate and entering in a correct input.
